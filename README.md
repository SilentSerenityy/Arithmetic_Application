### Arithmetic Application

This is an *Arithmetic Application* that I have coded in Python.

Upon running, you will be prompted with *Integer A* and *Integer B*.

There will be error fallbacks for: 
> if you try putting zeroes
> if you try leaving the spaces blank.

I will be adding more equations as the time goes on, so stay tuned!
